==========

`Snowmass 2021 Letters of Interest (LOI) <https://snowmass21.org/loi>`_ are informal documents intended to be useful in the first stages of the Snowmass study.
They will help Snowmass conveners to prepare the Snowmass Community Planning Meeting that will take place early November 2020 virtually.
LoIs could include opinions, interests and proposals that could further be studied.
They should contain a maximum of 2 pages of text, plus relevant bibliography.
Please make these as simple and easy to read as possible.
Authors of the letters are welcome to make a full writeup for their work as a contributed paper and submit it to the Snowmass proceedings.
However, a contributed paper is not required.

**LoIs should be contributed until ...** (Snowmass upload close-out: **August 31, 2020**).

For our interest group, we propose to use a simple template to simplify the process.
They can be contributed in the following ways:

* TODO: pull request example (pdf)
* TODO: or just sent per e-mail to ...


Tentative Plan
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(Might be still too prescriptive?)

* Encourage community building via co-authorship by as many authors as possible. One lead starts with an initial skeleton or draft, then augments and crystallizes writing with an increasing number of authors.
* Organizational structure for LOIs/paper:

  * 1 lead.
  * 1st tier co-writers: a few people.
  * 2nd tier co-authors:  more people.
  * third tier co-authors: everyone.
* Timeline:

  * Until July 10: organize ourselves, agree on topics, LOIs, structure and timeline.
  * July 10-August 21: one to two weeks per writing step (lead, 1st tier, 2nd tier, 3rd tier).
  * August 22-31: wrap-up and submit.


Templates
^^^^^^^^^

We suggest to use the following (tentative) template for LOIs...

* Topic and status.
* Current and future challenges.
* Advances needed to meet challenges.

   Do we collect contributions or do we advise authors to upload for themselves at https://snowmass21.org/loi ?
