Accelerator & Beam Physics Modeling
-----------------------------------

This is the homepage of the *Accelerator & beam physics modeling* interest group in the topical group `Theoretical Calculations and Simulation (CompF2) <https://snowmass21.org/computational/simulations>`_.
CompF2 is part of the `Computational Frontier (CompF) <https://snowmass21.org/computational/start>`_ in the `Snowmass 2021 <https://snowmass21.org>`_ process organized by the Division of Particles and Fields (DPF) of the American Physical Society.
